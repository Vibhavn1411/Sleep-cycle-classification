# Sleep-cycle-classification
This repository contains the code and resources for a sleep cycle classification project. The goal of this project is to classify different sleep stages using the Sleep-EDF dataset, which provides EEG recordings. We used Python to preprocess the data, extract hypnograms from the EDF files, and implement a Random Forest machine learning model to classify the sleep stages.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset available on PhysioNet. This dataset includes polysomnographic (PSG) sleep recordings that have been manually scored to label different sleep stages.

Results
The Random Forest model was able to classify sleep stages with an accuracy of around 90%. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics can be found in the models/ directory.

Acknowledgments
This project utilized the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset provided by PhysioNet. We are grateful for the availability of such open-source datasets that enable research and development in the field of sleep study.
